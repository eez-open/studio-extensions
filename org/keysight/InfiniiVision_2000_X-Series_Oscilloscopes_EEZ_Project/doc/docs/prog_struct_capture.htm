    for analysis. Remember that while the oscilloscope is responding to
    commands from the controller, it is not performing acquisitions. Also,
    when you change the oscilloscope configuration, any data already captured
    will most likely be rendered.</p><p>To collect data, you use the <a name="d0e1802"></a>:DIGitize command. This command clears the waveform buffers
    and starts the acquisition process. Acquisition continues until
    acquisition memory is full, then stops. The acquired data is displayed by
    the oscilloscope, and the captured data can be measured, stored in
    acquisition memory in the oscilloscope, or transferred to the controller
    for further analysis. Any additional commands sent while :DIGitize is
    working are buffered until :DIGitize is complete.</p><p>You could also put the oscilloscope into run mode, then use a wait
    loop in your program to ensure that the oscilloscope has completed at
    least one acquisition before you make a measurement. Agilent does not
    recommend this because the needed length of the wait loop may vary,
    causing your program to fail. :DIGitize, on the other hand, ensures that
    data capture is complete. Also, :DIGitize, when complete, stops the
    acquisition process so that all measurements are on displayed data, not on
    a constantly changing data set.</p></div></body></html>
